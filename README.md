# personal_scripts
just a few personal scripts that i use....

there are two folders:
  - one has scripts which I wrote (MyScrpts [yes there is a typo]):
      - archiver.py     
        - to simply archieve
      - bash_clean.sh   
        - to delete .bash_history
      - lock2load.sh    
        - to unlock and mount luks encrypted drives (just put in the sdx or sdxy)
      - locker.sh       
        - i3lock script with brightness management
      - lucker-sus.sh   
        - locker.sh with suspension (really helpful while using i3)
      - low_bat.sh      
        - low battery and overchaging notifier (useful in Window Managers where these don't already exist)
      - mkurandom
        - mkurandom [output file name] [number of bytes from /dev/urandom] => returns strings and writes them a file
      - musctl.sh       
        - to switch music player control application from mpc to playerctl and back
      - netswitch       
        - to toggle networking on/off
      - refresh-poly.sh 
        - to set and refresh polybar theme; restart picom, conky; reset wallpaper and terminal theme
      - tar-command.sh  
        - and old script i used to use before archiver.py


  - the other has scripts that I got off the internet:
      - leetspeak.py
        - a python2 script i got somewhere on reddit to convert text to various possible leetspeak combination
      - pintdl.py       
        - pintrest Downloader
      - text2pdf.c      
        - not exactly a script but a c program (you need to compile) to convert txt files to pdfs
